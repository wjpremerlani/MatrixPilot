Getting Started

Solder the pins you want to use.
Initially all you will need are power, ground, the serial port and the programming port.
It is also suggested that you use the solder blob to tie SVCC to VCC.
Obviously, you will also need to connect power, ground, RX and TX of your GPS.
Use either the 6 pin connector or the GTX and GRX pins plus 5V and ground.

Program your UDB with the accompanying .hex file, gyro_accelerometer_self_test.hex.
Instructions for that, programming_with_a_hex_file.rtf are also attached.

You do not need to connect a GPS to the board.

After that, cycle the power to the UDB with it more or less level.
It does not matter if you leave the picKIT connected to the UDB or not.

When the UDB powers up, the red and green LEDs will flash for a little while.

When they stop flashing the green LED will use the accelerometers
to indicate when the UDB is tipped, using only the X and Y channels.

The red LED will use all three gyros to indicate rotation rate.
